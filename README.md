# Single price grid component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my code 

## The challenge

The challenge is from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) amazing website to take coding challenges.

## Building the project

Building it was fun and easy I used a lot of hit and trial for the css also flexbox came handy for arranging the different sections, media query is always helpful for making a website responsive same was with my case just used one liner to make it responsive.
